<div class="Section1">
<p class="MsoNormal">So – I have decided to leave my company of 4 ½ years.&nbsp; It was a difficult decision, as any decision is to leave your company is.&nbsp; I really have enjoyed working with the various teams that I have been involved with.&nbsp; The main driving force was a greater need to connect with people locally.&nbsp; I currently work out of a remote office in Dallas, with the rest of my team being in Chicago, but I enjoy the atmosphere of working with a local team and being able to informally discuss issues and connect at a more personal level.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The problem – I submit my resignation, and <span style="color:#1f497d;">within a day</span>, I receive a counter offer.&nbsp; I won’t go into the specifics of what they offered me, but suffice it to say that I began to wonder if it wouldn’t be worth my while to stay for another year or two.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I write this post to explain to others and remind myself of why I decided to stick with my decision to leave my current employer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1.&nbsp; It’s all a mirage.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">The offer from my current employer only really existed the moment that I put my resignation in.&nbsp; Therefore, it’s really just an illusion.&nbsp; I can’t rationalize or try to get myself to believe that these two options were going to exist at the time of my initial decision.&nbsp; It was flattering, though. </p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">2.&nbsp; Potential Problems</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">I did all of the online research I could to see if accepting a counter offer was legitimate.&nbsp; Most information that I gathered suggested that it would not be a good idea, because 99% of the time the employee is gone within 6-12 months either because the original issue was not addressed by the counter offer or the employer replaced the person since they were disloyal.&nbsp; And most posts mentioned that it was an unethical move.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">3.&nbsp; <span><span>&nbsp;</span></span>Integrity is at issue.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">The moment that I began to entertain accepting the counter offer, I began to feel wrong inside.&nbsp; Although I agreed with all of the information I found online, that wasn’t what was really eating at me.&nbsp; I felt that I was wronging the company that I had said, “yes,” to.&nbsp; They would have to start their search all over again.&nbsp; That didn’t feel right.&nbsp; I couldn’t face myself in the mirror if I felt that I had done something to hurt someone.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">4.&nbsp; <span><span>&nbsp;</span></span>Spiritual</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And finally, as I lay in bed at night, I found myself crying out to God to give me wisdom.&nbsp; I wanted to make sure that whatever I chose to do, it was what the Lord thought was right.&nbsp; And at 2:00 am in the morning, the day before I rejected the counter offer, a verse came to my mind that I had not read for over 6 months:&nbsp; “Who swears to his own hurt, and does not change…”&nbsp; This is part of a larger passage of scripture in Psalms chapter 15, where King David asks “O <span class="small-caps">Lord</span>, who shall sojourn in your tent?&nbsp; Who shall dwell on your holy hill?”&nbsp; And the list that follows explains the qualities of one who can fellowship with the Lord.&nbsp; And keeping promises must be high on His list.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I couldn’t deny the voice of God.&nbsp; Accepting a counter offer was wrong not only because it isn’t real, it might potentially cause me harm, and it might damage my reputation with others.&nbsp; It might also cause harm to my neighbor – or in this case, my future employer.&nbsp; I couldn’t do that with a good conscience.&nbsp; It would keep me from fellowshipping with the One whom I don’t want to miss out on.</p>
