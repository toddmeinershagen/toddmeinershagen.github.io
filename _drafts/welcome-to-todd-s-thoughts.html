<p>Hi - welcome to my new <a href="https://toddmeinershagen.wordpress.com">site</a>!</p>

<p>You're live! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at <code>&amp;lt;your blog URL&amp;gt;/ghost/</code>. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>
<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item number one</li>
<li>Item number two</li>
<li>A nested item</li>
<li>A final item</li>
</ul>
<p>or with numbers!</p>
<ol>
<li>Remember to buy some milk</li>
<li>Drink the milk</li>
<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href="http://ghost.org">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>
<h3>What about Images?</h3>
<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ghost.png" alt="The Ghost Logo" /></p>
<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

<h3>Quoting</h3>
<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Ghost - Just a blogging platform
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Working with Code</h3>
<p>Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>
<p>[code lang=css]<br />
.awesome-thing {<br />
  display: block;<br />
  width: 100%;<br />
}<br />
[/code]</p>
<h3>Ready for a Break?</h3>
<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Advanced Usage</h3>
<p>There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.</p>
<p>&lt;input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!" /&gt;</p>
<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>
