<p>I am amazed at the amount of free services being provided on the internet! Will there be a day when I no longer have to maintain my own file share on a local hard drive? Will I be able to store everything out in the "cloud"?</p>
<p>Google has capitalized the market with free services like email, chat, calendaring, and photo albums. They are even offering to let you use their services as a suite for free within your small organization under <a href="http://www.google.com/a">your own domain</a>.  Microsoft and others are trying to catch up with the services bandwagon, but clearly Google is in the lead.</p>
