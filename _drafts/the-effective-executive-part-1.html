<p>I am going to write several posts on the book, because I want to remember the important points from the book, and I would also like to share the most interesting portions with you.  This first post will be a quick intro to the book.</p>
<p>The book is a mere 174 pages, but it takes time to read and digest the content.  The first chapter discusses the need for effectiveness and idea that effectiveness can be learned by anyone.  </p>
<p>What is effectiveness you say?  Well, Drucker makes the distinction of doing the right things rather than do things the right way.  Too many are busy doing work with no clue as to what contribution that work is really making to the organization.</p>
<p>After establishing the fact that effectiveness is important to knowledge workers and that effectiveness can be learned, the author then launches into 6 chapters explaining the most important aspects of practicing the habit of being effective.</p>
<p>1.  Know where the time goes.</p>
<p>2.  Focus on outward contribution.</p>
<p>3.  Build on strengths - individual, peer, superior and subordinate.</p>
<p>4.  Concentrate on a few major areas to achieve results.</p>
<p>5.  Make effective decisions. </p>
<p>I have not read all of the chapters, but just skimming the book has provided invaluable insights into becoming effective.  I will try to discuss each of the aspects above in future posts. </p>
