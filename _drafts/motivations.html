<p>I found this <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5550373/the-surprising-realities-behind-what-motivates-us-in-illustrated-form">video</a> about what motivates people to be very refreshing.  Basically, if the tasks that people are working on require more than a basic physical action, money rewards don't motivate, but rather demotivate people.  What really motivates others to perform well at conceptual tasks are three things:  autonomy, self mastery, and purpose.  What I find is that Agile practices tend to foster or work within these motivations.  
<div></div>
<div>For example, user stories really help to zero in on the purpose for a given feature request.  "As a [actor], I can [do something], so that I can [accomplish a goal]."  Developers really get a sense for why they are building a piece of functionality rather than just focusing on building a method, etc.  And the prioritization of these stories helps to clarify what is truly important within a sprint.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As well, agile practices promote mastery by emphasizing continual improvement.  Teams are encouraged to use the processes that work for an individual team rather than trying to create a process that will work for an entire organization.  Other principles such as refactoring and unit testing also suggest an intense focus on continually improving the code base.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And finally, the scrum meeting and agile planning in general focus on the team working together on deciding the priorities rather than having a central authority such as a PM do that.  Individuals make themselves accountable to the team by explaining what they accomplished yesterday and what they plan to accomplish for the current day.  This creates a sense of autonomy in those performing the work.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I would be interested to hear your thoughts on the video as well as whether or not you agree that agile practices help to foster these motivations. </div>
