<p>I was reading through my blogs tonight and came across <a href="http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?Function=edetail&amp;ObjectType=COL&amp;ObjectId=16277&amp;tth=DYN&amp;tt=siteemail&amp;iDyn=2" target="_blank">one</a> that did a nice job of explaining the qualities that an agile team member should possess.  In addition, the writer included a good behavioral interview question for each.<br />I briefly share each below, but I highly recommend reading the <a href="http://www.stickyminds.com/sitewide.asp?Function=edetail&amp;ObjectType=COL&amp;ObjectId=16277&amp;tth=DYN&amp;tt=siteemail&amp;iDyn=2" target="_blank">original article</a>.<br />1. <u>People Who Collaborate</u><br /><em>"Think back to a recent project. Give me an example of a time you had to work with other people to make sure that you could finish something. What happened?"</em> <br />2. <u>People Who Ask for Help</u><br /><em>"Think back to your most recent project. Tell me about a time you did not understand something. What did you do?" </em><br />3. <u>People Who are Willing to Take Small Steps and Get Feedback</u><br /><em>"When you work on your projects outside of work, how do you work?"</em> <br />4. <u>People Who are Willing To Do Something That is Good Enough for Now</u><br /><em>"Tell me about a recent time you did not know everything at the beginning of the project. What did you do?"</em> <br />5. <u>Adaptable People</u><br /><em>"Tell me about a time when you did not have the conditions you would've liked for your project. What did you do?"</em> <br />6. <u>People Willing to Work Outside Their Expertise</u><br /><em>"Tell me about a time you took on work to help the team. What was that like?"</em> <br />So, tell me dear Reader – what questions do you ask when interviewing candidates for an agile-oriented team?</p>
