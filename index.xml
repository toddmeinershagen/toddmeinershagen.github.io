      <description>I am a big proponent of unit testing my code because of the many benefits it provides:
 Helps me to catch potential bugs early Helps me to clarify the behavior of my units (classes) from a client perspective Leaves a documentation trail for those that come behind me to understand my intentions  The only irritation/friction I have found in the past is the fact that running unit tests has required me to manually run them on a periodic basis.</description>
