I have always taken to heart what Will Rogers once said, 

> Good judgment comes from experience,  
> and a lot of that comes from bad judgment.

And while I have agreed and laughed at it's sentiment, I have fought hard to try to avoid it's implications.  I don't want to make mistakes (in this case "bad judgement".), so I try either very hard to make the "right" decisions in my behavior/responses or try to read up on how others recommend I ought to behave or react in a given situation.

But, the scriptures say that we cannot avoid making mistakes.  And it is correction or discipline that God uses to allow us to learn.

> To learn, you must love discipline;  
> It is stupid to hate correction.  
<span>(Proverbs 12:1)</span>
